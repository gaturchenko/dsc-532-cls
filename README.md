Superstore Marketing Campaign Data Analysis Repository
Utilized publicly available “Superstore Marketing Campaign Dataset” to explore the factors, influencing the probability of response to a marketing campaign offer. Employed methods and models, such as logistic regression and its ridge/lasso implementations, SMOTE upsampling, PCA, LDA and QDA, Naïve Bayes, and KNN. Benchmarked the explainable models against more flexible tree-based classifiers. The analysis was carried out using R.
